//1
// in user database schema add new key "photo" and "secret"
// on user registration, let user to add his photo url
// when user registers, you generate random string value and save it to "secret" key
// when user will login, we send "secret" to front end
// in front end we save "secret" to local storage
// secret needed for later requests validation (requests where user should be logged in to make them)

// this photo can be retrieved only if user provides his "secret"
// user sends his secret to this route, you check if user exists by this secret
// find user by secret and return only his photo to front-end
//3
